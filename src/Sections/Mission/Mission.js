        I was tired of getting rugged. By either tokens that were memes or
        tokens that promised their functionality but never kept their words. I
        wanted to make a community token without any developer wallet. Although
        it may have been foolish, because some have contacted me, asking me for
        funds for marketing but they all left once I told them that I had no
        personal shares of the token myself. But then I'd be breaking my promise
        of having no dev wallet. We can grow together as a community. That's so
        say that if you are a developer and want to join us, to make it better
        then come here. If you're a front-ender, marketer, an artist - cool logo
        or you've just got any ideas or anyways that you think you can help.
        Tell me. We will not let your talent go to waste. We'll hold polls as a
        community and make this token grow. Make a platform that grows. Together
        we can turn it into an exchange, an NFT spot, a business, an anything!
        There's really no limit to where we can go if we work on it together as
        a team. Come join us. I will share my personal wallet holding on this if
        you think you can make it grow. If you think you've got the talent,
        idea, the smarts, anything. Come!
